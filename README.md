Kaggle Seizure Detection Challenge
=========
Solution for [Kaggle Seizure Detection Challenge](http://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-detection).
Convolutional neural networks were applied to raw EEG data in a bad way:
features from different channels were combined only in the hidden layer.
Better solution is described in [my thesis](https://github.com/IraKorshunova/kaggle-seizure-prediction/blob/master/thesis.pdf).
